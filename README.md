# Predict-Employee-Turnover-with-scikit-learn

In this project, we will use Python and scikit-learn to grow decision trees and random forests, and apply them to an important business problem. Additionally, we will learn to interpret decision trees and random forest models using feature importance plots. Leverage Jupyter widgets to build interactive controls, we can change the parameters of the models on the fly with graphical controls, and see the results in real time!

## In this Guided Project, you will:

- Apply decision trees and random forests with scikit-learn to classification problems

- Interpret decision trees and random forest models using feature importances

- Tune model hyperparamters to improve classification accuracy

- Create interactive, GUI components in Jupyter notebooks using widgets.

## Following steps are performed:

- Introduction and Importing Libraries

- Exploratory Data Analysis

- Encode Categorical Features

- Visualize Class Imbalance

- Create Training and Test Sets

- Build a Decision Tree Classifier with Interactive Controls

- Build a Decision Tree Classifier with Interactive Controls (Continued)

- Build a Random Forest Classifier with Interactive Controls

- Feature Importance and Evaluation Metrics
